Rabbit Hole

# Project Description

Rabbit Hole is an on-chain achievement system to get users using crypto while feeling like a game. Using TheGraph, Rabbit Hole queries on-chain activity and assigns a score to various smart contract interactions. If a user has completed the task, they gain XP and badges. Eventually, Rabbit Hole will be curated entirely by the community to determine what the best possible path is to guide a new user down the Rabbit Hole.

The benefits of Rabbit Hole is two-fold: 1) acquisition for dApps for users to understand how to use their advanced smart contracts and 2) guide the user from beginner-friendly smart contracts to more advanced smart contracts.

Rabbit Hole integrates with 3box so users can write their XP to their 3box profiles. Third-party dApps can use Rabbit Hole XP as a "Crypto IQ" to determine how qualified a user is based off their smart-contract interactions.
